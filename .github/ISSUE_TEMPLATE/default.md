Bug reports or features requests for the module should be opened in the [upstream repository](https://github.com/gilbsgilbs/LocationIndicatorWhitelist/issues/new) where the code lives. You may open an issue here if and only if it's related to the LSposed repository metadata (e.g. missing metadata in LSposed, wrong app name in LSposed, â€¦).
